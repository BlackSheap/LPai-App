📦 MongoDB Database Structure – LPai App
MongoDB is the source of truth for the mobile CRM app. All data from GoHighLevel (GHL) is mirrored into MongoDB and accessed via secure Next.js API routes.

🔐 Multi-Tenant Security Model
Each user is tied to a GHL Location via locationId.

All data is scoped and filtered by locationId in backend routes.

Each GHL Location can have multiple users with role: 'admin' or role: 'user'.

Users authenticate through the backend and receive a JWT token containing:

userId

locationId

role

All client requests are verified server-side against the token to prevent cross-location access.

🗂️ Collections & Relationships
users
Mirrors GHL sub-users

Fields: name, email, role, locationId, permissions, hashedPassword

Authenticated users are scoped by locationId and userId

contacts
Root-level CRM object (mirrors GHL Contacts)

Fields: firstName, lastName, email, phone, address, ghlContactId, locationId, createdAt, notes

Linked: Each project.contactId → contacts._id

projects
Mirrors GHL Opportunities

Fields: title, status, contactId, userId, locationId, createdAt

One-to-many: A contact can have multiple projects

Status-based flow: Open → Quoted → Scheduled → Job Complete

quotes
Generated per project

Fields: projectId, userId, locationId, scopeOfWork, total, status, createdAt

Tied to projects._id

appointments
Mirrors GHL appointments

Fields: contactId, userId, locationId, type, time, ghlAppointmentId, createdAt

Linked to both contacts and users

libraries
Admin-created part libraries for quote building

Scoped to locationId

Structure: categories[] → items[]

🛡️ Security Practices
🔑 Authentication: All access is token-based using JWTs (stored in AsyncStorage)

🧾 Authorization:

Backend routes enforce locationId checks before any DB access

User roles (admin/user) can restrict UI features client-side

📁 Data Isolation: No cross-location access is possible

🧼 Sanitization: Input values validated both frontend and backend

🔄 Syncing: GHL remains the system of record for triggers, but MongoDB is the source of truth for the app
